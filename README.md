# Data Science Portfolio
I am a highly motivated and adaptable math teacher in the middle of a career transition into data science.  This change started when I was taking statisitic courses as part of my Master's in Mathematics from Californina State University Fullerton (CSUF) and has led me through Google's Data Analysitcs Certificate, Microsofts PL-300 Ceritfication for Power BI, a post graduate certificate in Data Science from the University of Texas, and independantly studying neuaral networks.  My goal is to get an entry level position as a data scientist that will allow me to continue to learn and apply my knoweldge.  If you know a position you think I would be a good match for, please reach out to me via email at wyattehooper@gmail.com.

Below is an orginized list of projects that I have completed as evidence of what I have learned. 

## Postgraduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics
This is a 6 month online program that teaches an introduction to machine learning using python.  There are video lectures, quizes, weekly mentor sessions and 7 course projects, and a capstone project.

- [Project 1: Food Hub](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/Project1_FoodHub.ipynb) The Food Hub dataset was pulled from delivery services like Grubhub. This dataset contained 9 variables with 1,898 rows of data.  My task was to answer key questions about the data and preform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to make insights that might help the business.
- [Project 2: ENews Express](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/Project2_ENewsExpress.ipynb) The Enews Express dataset comes from on online news publication.  The goal of this project was to preform A/B testing to determine if a new landing page increased the time people spent on the page, or affected the conversion rate.
- [Project 3: Recell](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/Project3_Recell.ipynb) The Recell dataset has 15 variables and 3,454 rows of data about used electronic devices.  The goal of this project was to use the given data to predict the normailized used prices with a multilinear model.  I had to  preform EDA, treat missing values, encode the categorical variables,  split the data into X_train and X_test, train a linear regeression model, check the assumptions of linear regression was met, and test the model's preformance.
- [Project 4: INN Hotels](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/Project4_INNHotels.ipynb) The INN Hotels dataset describes hotel bookings.  The dataset has 19 variables with 36,275 rows.  The goal of this project was to use logistic regression and a decision tree model to classify each booking as "Canceled" or "Not Canceled". This project included preforming EDA, imputting missing data, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, testing models, pre-pruning and post-pruning decision trees.

## Comepetitions
- [Kaggle: House Price Predictor](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/KaggleHousingPriceWinner.ipynb) Uses piplines, imputers and encoders to prepare a dataset on housing prices to make a prediction using XGBoostRegressor and preforms pre-pruning with BayesSearchCV.  This model scored 421st place out of 86,278 when submitted

## Teaching
- [OnRamps College Algebra Semester Analysis](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/SemesterData(Shareable).ipynb) A EDA of the college grades for a section of OnRamps College Algebra.
- [TSIAA2 Exam Analysis](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/TSIA2_AnalysisShareable.ipynb) A EDA of TSIA 2.0 Exam scores.
- [Formal Limit Definition Annimation](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/FormalLimDef.ipynb) Used the Manim Python library to create an animation to communicate the idea behind the limit definition.  [Link to Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8zTbI4jCNE)
- [AP Calculus Course Tracker](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/APCalculusCourseMasteryTracker.xlsx) A tracker meant to help teachers track student mastery of AP Calculus objectives.  The first page is an overview to see averages for each section and lesson.  Every unit has an addition page where you can input scores and see both indivual student data as well as averages.
- [AP Calculus Student Tracker](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/APCalculusScholarMasteryReport.xlsx) A tracker meant to help individual students track their mastery of AP Calculus objectives.  Connects to the AP Calculus Course Tracker to automatically update students and course average scores.  It also provides a list of resources for each objective to help with targeted studying. 

## Others
- [Dooms Day in C++](https://github.com/Math-Wise/Portfolio/blob/main/DoomsDay.cpp) A C++ program that calculuate the day of the week any date in history was.
