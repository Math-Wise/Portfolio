		<p>My passion is to help people develop their potenial.  I believe that everyone holds greatness within themselve, but that it takes a strong community to push individuals to become great.  I have focused on teaching dynamic problem solving, creative thinking and multi-persective approches through the study of mathematics and unrestricted body control and complete physical health thourgh the discipline of parkour.  Beyond that I have worked developing practial skills of design, construction, and coding.</p>

		<p class="projects"> Website </p>
		<p class="column">The RSA encryter that I wrote in SAGEmath inputs a file and exports a encrypted file.  RSA is primaily used to store passwords in a way that no one can access them.  RSA works by converting message first into ASCII.  ASCII is a widely known key to convert messages into numbers.  Now that the file is one long number, RSA works taking two large primes, n and m and then multiplying (n-1)(m-1).  The resulting number is stored along with another number, e that that divids it.  These two numbers are you encrytion key.  Anyone with these numbers and encrypt messages, but not decrypt them.  The ASCII message is broken down into strings of length one less then (n-1)(m-1).  Let each string be represented as A1 to An, with i between 1 and n.  At this point each one of the ASCII strings, A1 to An are placed into the the formula Ei=Ai^e(mod N) where Ei is the encryted version of Ai.  Then all of the Ei are placed into a vector.  This vector is the encryted message.  For more information on the RSA encrypter or the decrypter click here.  <img src="RSA.jpg"></p>
		<p class="column"> This website was designed and coded by me.  I took this on as a challenge to learn html, css, and java.  I started out by watching Youtube tutorails from LearnCode.academy's channel and googleing specific questions that arised.  Before starting this project I had experience in C++ and Python.  However this project was still a brand new type of coding that I was not fimiliar with.  Along with the technical aspects of coding, the design of the website also presented a new challenge for me.  Though this was challenging and took a lot of time it taught me both practial skills, and allowed me to push my ability to learn new things. </p>
